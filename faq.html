									<b>Q: Why is it called Optic Design?</b>
									<br>
									"Optic Design is named accordingly because, as you may have noticed, Web design
									is a visual medium.  You can't taste it, smell it, or touch it.  Occasionally,
									you might hear a sound byte, but that's a whole separate world.  So 'Optic,'
									meaning "pertaining to the eye or sight" describes the medium perfectly."
									<p><b>
									Q: Do I have to choose a design package?</b>
									<br>
									"No. You
<em>
										can</em>, but you don't have to.  You can pay by the individual element, or you can
									choose a package and then pay for each extra element that you want added."
									<p><b>
								Q: How do your prices compare to the rest of the market?</b>
									<br>
									"Optic Design is priced on the low end of the design scene.  With the amount of
									talent at work, we depend on volume of customers to make up for the extra money
									we don't charge."
<p><b>Q: Do you offer domain hosting?</b>
									<br>
									"No. We are first and foremost a design firm.  We use the service of <a href="http://www.affordablehost.com/">Affordable	Host</a> for hosting and registration."

									<p><b>
									Q: What is a 'favorites' icon, or 'favicon'?</b>
									<br>
									"A favicon is the little picture you see next to the name of the site when you
									add it to your favorites in Internet Explorer 5.0 and above."
									<p><b>
									Q: How do I contact Optic Design for a job I want done?</b>
									<br>
									"Use our
									<a href="contact.html" style="color:#8866BB">contact</a>
									page.  After we receive your e-mail, we will contact you personally within 24
									hours."
									<p>
									"Why should you choose Optic?  Well, that's completely up to you.  You stumbled
									upon this site for some reason, whether it was casual surfing, referral, we
									don't know.  But you're here!  If you find the design quality intriguing, or
									it's just what you're looking for, you can contact us through the
									<a href="contact.html" style="color: #8866BB">contact page</a>
									or you can send us an e-mail at
									<a href="mailto:info@opticdesign.com" style="color: #8866BB">info@opticdesign.com</a>
